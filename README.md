# DWM config file

This repository simply contains my configuration file for the tiling window
manager [dwm][dwm]. It works with an unpatched dwm (version 5.9 and perhaps
others) and sets up tags labelled for specific tasks. Specific applications are
automatically tagged when they are launched. In addition, the ctrl-shift-alt-q
key combination is added to kill dwm, which is useful for certain setups, such
as launching dwm in an infinite loop from an initialization script named "dwm".
